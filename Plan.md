# Phase 1: Core IPC Mechanisms

## Step 1: Message Queue Fundamentals

**Objective:**  
Learn and implement the basics of message queues.

**Tasks:**
- Understand how to generate a key with `ftok` (using a designated file and project ID).
- Create and access a message queue using `msgget`.
- Send a simple message using `msgsnd` from a "sender" process.
- Receive that message using `msgrcv` in a "receiver" process.

**Outcome:**  
A working demo where a message is sent and received between two processes.

## Step 2: Shared Memory Basics

**Objective:**  
Implement shared memory to store data accessible by multiple processes.

**Tasks:**
- Learn how to create a shared memory segment using `shmget`.
- Attach and detach the shared memory using `shmat` and `shmdt`.
- Write and read data to/from the shared segment.
- Consider initial synchronization (basic, without advanced locks) for safe access.

**Outcome:**  
A simple demo where two processes share and update a common data segment.

# Phase 2: Integrating IPC into the Chat Application

## Step 3: Design Application Architecture

**Objective:**  
Define how the components will interact.

**Tasks:**
- **Server Process:**
  - Manages the message queue for incoming chat messages.
  - Updates the shared chat log stored in shared memory (with synchronization).
- **Client Process:**
  - Sends messages via the message queue.
  - Reads from the shared memory to display the current chat log.

**Outcome:**  
A clear diagram and design document outlining data flow and responsibilities.

## Step 4: Implement Basic Chat Functionality

**Objective:**  
Build a minimal version of the chat app.

**Tasks:**
- Implement client registration and basic message exchange using message queues.
- Update and display the chat log stored in shared memory.
- Add simple synchronization (using semaphores or mutexes) to protect access to the shared memory.

**Outcome:**  
A prototype where one or more clients can send messages to the server and the shared chat log is updated and visible.

# Phase 3: Incorporating Virtual Memory (mmap)

## Step 5: Virtual Memory for Persistent Chat Log

**Objective:**  
Utilize `mmap` to create a persistent, memory-mapped chat log.

**Tasks:**
- Create or open a file that will store the chat log.
- Map the file into memory using `mmap`, allowing both read and write.
- Replace or complement the in-memory shared chat log with the memory-mapped file.
- Ensure synchronization (using file locks or semaphores) when updating the memory-mapped file.

**Outcome:**  
A persistent chat log that demonstrates virtual memory usage and survives process restarts.

# Phase 4: Final Integration, Testing, and Refinement

## Step 6: Integration and Advanced Features

**Objective:**  
Bring all components together and refine functionality.

**Tasks:**
- Merge the message queue and shared memory/mmap parts into a single coherent system.
- Handle client connections/disconnections gracefully.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging.
- Test with multiple client processes to ensure reliable synchronization and message delivery.

**Outcome:**  
A stable, integrated chat application that uses IPC, shared memory, and `mmap`.

---

## Step 7: Documentation and Final Testing

**Objective:**  
Ensure the project is well-documented and robust.

**Tasks:**
- Write clear documentation on how to build and run the project.
- Create a user guide and developer notes explaining the architecture and synchronization mechanisms.
- Perform stress testing and debugging.

**Outcome:**  
A complete, well-documented project ready for demonstration or further expansion.
